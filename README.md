# 🙋🏽‍♂️ Domain-Driven Design & Nuxt - Using Nuxt Modules to structure large Nuxt Apps

# Nuxt 2

This is the legacy branch for the Nuxt 2 version of the demo app. For the Nuxt 3 version, please check out the [main branch](https://github.com/areindl/nuxt-structure-with-modules).

## 👨🏼‍💻 Demo

1. This Nuxt.js 2 app is a barebone create-nuxt-app installation
2. As a showcase example, the app adds two modules: a blog module and a shop module
3. The modules are implemented as a [Nuxt Module](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/modules#write-your-own-module) with their individual routing, store, etc.
